  <h1>VigilAI — Safety Intelligence Demo</h1>
  <p>
    VigilAI is a personal safety monitoring system that can detect trip deviations, unusual stops,
    and non-response events and notify trusted contacts. It is designed as a proactive safety layer
    and does not require continuous tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User explicitly starts a trip and selects trusted contacts.</li>
    <li>The system evaluates movement, route deviation, and “silence” (no movement / no heartbeat / no response).</li>
    <li>If risk exceeds thresholds, it sends a CHECK (“Are you OK?”) before escalating.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Messaging</h2>
  <p>
    Messages are transactional safety notifications sent only after the user opts in by starting a trip.
    Recipients may opt out by replying STOP.
